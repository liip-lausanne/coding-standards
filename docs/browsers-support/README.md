# Browsers Support

## Browserslist

We use [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) to configure the browsers we want to support. Although this depends on the project and client requirements, our current default settings are:

```
>1% in CH
not dead
```

We prefer to define this in a `.browserslistrc` file at the project root.

## CSS compatibility

We use [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to automatically add vendor-prefixed properties required by the browsers defined above. Autoprefixer automatically reads Browserslist settings.

## JavaScript compatibility

The project should use a tool that reads the Browserslist file above and transpile the code accordingly. It can be [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) with [@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) for example.

### Polyfills

::: warning
Now that Internet Explorer is dead and features are rolled out fast to all major browsers, polyfills arenâ€™t common anymore. Please consider using native & well supported features first.
:::

Language can be transpiled but features must be polyfilled.

If you use `@babel/preset-env`, you can set the option `useBuiltIns` to `usage` to automatically load the necessary polyfills based on your code and Browserslist settings (see above). Then, install [core-js@3](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) and set the option `corejs` to `3`.

The [@babel/plugin-transform-runtime](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-runtime) plugin should also be used to enable the re-use of Babel's injected helper code and save on codesize.

```js
// babel.config.js

module.exports = {
  presets: [
    [
      '@babel/preset-env',
      {
        useBuiltIns: 'usage',
        corejs: 3,
      },
    ],
  ],
  plugins: [
    [
      '@babel/plugin-transform-runtime',
      {
        corejs: 3,
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```
