# Style Guides

We tend to create [living style guides](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/creating-a-living-style-guide-case-study/) to document our projects’ front-end components. We like to use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) or [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) for this purpose as they provides a lot of features and can be easily customized.

Fractal doesn’t handle assets management on its own, therefor we made [our own starterkit](https://github.com/liip/styleguide-starterkit) that is preconfigured with a couple of tools, especially webpack.

We also have a [Storybook starterkit](https://github.com/liip/storybook-starterkit) with a bunch of predefined config and addons.

Check out the [Liip Styleguide](https://styleguide.liip.ch/) for an example using Fractal.
