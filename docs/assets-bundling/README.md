## Vite

We prefer [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) over other build tools, because:

- it works out of the box with all our usual file types
- has a built-in dev server with <abbr title="Hot Module Replacement">HMR</abbr>
- itâ€™s super fast
- can be integrated with all type of backends

## Webpack

Older projects, and projects that requires it for whatever reason can use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) instead.
